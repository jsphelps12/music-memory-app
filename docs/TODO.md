# Tracks — Non-Development To-Do

Things to work on outside of coding sessions.

---

## Beta Testing & Feedback

- [ ] Get TestFlight build approved (follow up if still pending)
- [ ] Recruit 5-10 beta testers — target people who share songs, make playlists, or tie music to memories
- [ ] Watch at least 2-3 people use the app in person — note where they hesitate or get confused
- [ ] Ask each tester: "What would make you open this every day?"
- [ ] Collect and organize feedback into themes (friction points, missing features, what they love)

## UI/UX Sketching & Mocking

- [ ] Sketch the quick capture flow — what's the minimum viable moment? How fast can you go from now playing to saved?
- [ ] Mock the iOS widget — what does it show? Now playing + "save" button? Last moment? On This Day?
- [ ] Design the "On This Day" resurfacing experience — how does it appear? Push notification? In-app card? Both?
- [ ] Sketch the candidate picker for Spotify cross-search — is the current modal good enough or does it need polish?
- [ ] Think through the share extension UX end-to-end — what happens when someone shares a non-music link?

## Positioning & Messaging

- [ ] Write a one-sentence pitch (if you can't explain it in one sentence, sharpen the concept)
- [ ] Decide: is Tracks a "capture" app (speed, low friction) or a "reflect" app (journaling, depth)? Pick one to lead with
- [ ] Write the App Store description (subtitle, promotional text, full description)
- [ ] Identify 3 apps to position against — what does Tracks do that they don't?

## App Store Prep

- [ ] Take polished screenshots in both light and dark mode with real data
- [ ] Design App Store preview screenshots (consider using a tool like Rotato or Screenshots Pro)
- [ ] Pick App Store category (likely Music or Lifestyle)
- [ ] Write a privacy policy (required for submission)
- [ ] Draft the "What's New" text for your first public release

## Business Model

- [ ] Decide if the premium tier ($7/month) is real or aspirational
- [ ] If real: draw the free vs. paid line — what do free users get forever?
- [ ] Research RevenueCat setup requirements so you're ready when the time comes
- [ ] Look at how similar apps (Day One, Spotify, Finch) structure their paywalls

## Growth & Distribution

- [ ] Identify communities where potential users hang out (music subreddits, playlist communities, journaling groups)
- [ ] Plan a soft launch strategy — who are the first 100 users and how do you reach them?
- [ ] Consider a landing page or simple site for the app (even a Carrd or single-page site)

## Retention Thinking

- [ ] Map out the day 1 → day 7 → day 30 user journey — what brings them back?
- [ ] Prioritize "On This Day" resurfacing — it's probably the single highest-leverage retention feature
- [ ] Think about notification strategy — what's helpful vs. annoying? How often?
