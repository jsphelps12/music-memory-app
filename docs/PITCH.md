## By Conversation Length

### At a party (10 seconds)
*"It's like a journal, but for music. You log a song, write what it meant to you in that moment, and the app brings it back to you a year later. You end up with a soundtrack of your life."*

### In a meeting (60 seconds)
*"Everyone has songs that are permanently tied to a memory — a breakup, a road trip, a person, a version of themselves they've almost forgotten. But there's nowhere to hold that. Spotify tells you what you listened to most. It can't tell you why that one song at 2am on a Tuesday changed something.*

*Tracks is where you put that. You log the song, write a reflection, maybe add a photo. The app holds it. A year later, it resurfaces it — 'on this day, you were listening to this.' Over time it becomes a living record of who you've been.*

*The acquisition hook is weddings and events — one QR code at a reception brings in 30–100 new users from a single event. But the core product is deeply personal. It's a nostalgia engine."*

## The Full Pitch

### The Problem

Music is the strongest involuntary memory trigger humans have. A song can transport you to a specific afternoon, a specific version of yourself, a feeling you'd forgotten existed. Everyone knows this — it's not a niche insight.

But there's nowhere to hold it intentionally. You hear a song that wrecks you and you think "I need to remember this moment" — and then you don't. It drifts. The song still plays in your library but the context is gone.

Spotify knows everything you've listened to. It can tell you your top artists, your most-played songs, how many minutes of music you consumed. What it can't tell you is why you played that song 47 times in October 2023. What you were going through. What it meant.

That gap — between the data and the meaning — is the product.

### The Solution

Tracks is a music memory app. You log a song, write what it means to you right now, attach a mood, photos, location, people. The app holds it. It resurfaces it on the anniversary. Over years it becomes a structured, living record of who you've been — organized into eras, patterns, chapters.

**Logging is the investment. Resurfacing is the dividend.**

The core loop is six steps: Listen → Log → Resurface → Reflect → Share → Repeat. Every feature serves one of those steps. Anything that doesn't is deprioritized.

### The Insight

The people who need this app don't need to be taught the concept. They already say things like:

- *"I can't hear that song without thinking about that summer."*
- *"That album was my entire senior year."*
- *"That song got me through my divorce."*
- *"I remember exactly where I was when I first heard this."*

They just don't have a structured place to hold it. Tracks gives them that place.

**This isn't a journaling app with music bolted on. It's not a music player with notes.** It's its own category: organizing nostalgia. The moat is the interpretation layer — using music + mood + time + reflection data to surface things the user didn't consciously notice about themselves.

### The Business Model

**Free tier monetizes logging. Premium tier monetizes meaning.**

Free users keep all logging features forever — unlimited moments, search, On This Day resurfacing, shared collections. The core habit never gets paywalled.

Premium ($4.99/month or $39.99/year) unlocks the meaning layer:
- Era clustering — your life organized into named chapters ("Winter of Letting Go", "The Comeback Summer")
- Pattern insights — "You log 3x more on weekends. Bon Iver correlates with processing emotions."
- Mood trajectory, music taste evolution, AI narrative summaries

**The conversion trigger:** after 25–30 moments, a locked Era card appears — *"Unlock the chapter you just lived."* Not "upgrade for more storage." The paywall is meaning, not access.

Additional revenue: a one-time **Events tier** ($39.99/event) for weddings and concerts — extended collections, QR code generation, book export. And a **physical memory book** ($80–150) — a hardcover with QR codes on every page that play the song when you point your phone at it. No competitor can build this without the underlying music memory data.

Break-even at ~120 annual subscribers. Path to living off it at ~2,000.

### The Growth Engine

Tracks currently has no network effects — every user's experience is independent. That's a ceiling. The answer isn't a social network. It's one mechanic that's better with two people than one.

**Weddings are the acquisition flywheel.**

A couple creates a shared collection and puts a QR code on every table at the reception. Every guest logs what songs meant something during the day. The couple ends up with a collaborative soundtrack of their wedding from every guest's perspective — an artifact they'll keep forever. One event brings in 30–100 new users.

That generalizes: concerts, road trips, album releases, study abroad cohorts, family holidays. Every shared collection is a personalized invite campaign. The B2B angle — partnering with wedding planners who manage 20–40 weddings per year — makes this a scalable acquisition channel, not just a clever feature.

After acquisition, the conversion funnel is tight:
1. Guest logs a moment into the collection → it saves to their personal timeline
2. App tells them: *"This moment is yours forever, not just for this event."*
3. One week later: *"What song's been in your head since the wedding?"*
4. One year later: On This Day resurfaces their wedding memory → personal habit forms
5. At 25–30 personal moments: Era paywall

A wedding guest who downloaded for someone else becomes a paying subscriber 12–18 months later.

### Why Now

- Spotify Wrapped proved the market: people are deeply hungry for meaning around their music history, not just stats. Wrapped generates cultural envy every December. Tracks is the version people actually want — yours, not algorithmic, year-round.
- iOS 16+ capabilities (ShazamKit, Dynamic Island, Live Activities, Shortcuts) make frictionless capture finally possible — log a moment from the concert floor without unlocking your phone.
- AI makes the interpretation layer viable for the first time — era clustering and narrative summaries are features that genuinely couldn't exist 5 years ago.

### Competitive Landscape

| | Music | Memory | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spotify | ✓ | — | — |
| Apple Music | ✓ | — | — |
| Day One | — | ✓ | partial |
| Apple Photos | — | ✓ (visual) | — |
| **Tracks** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

The real risk isn't competition — it's building the wrong version. "Day One but with songs" loses. The moat is the interpretation layer. If it disappears tomorrow, users miss: *being reminded of moments they lived, and being able to relive them through music.*

### The Vision

After 10 years of using Tracks, a user should feel nostalgic, grateful, grounded, seen, and occasionally shocked. Shocked by how much they've lived. Shocked by patterns they never consciously noticed. Shocked that a song from 8 years ago still means the same thing.

That's the product. Everything else is in service of it.

## Common Questions

**"Isn't this just Spotify with a notes field?"**
No — Spotify is a discovery and playback tool. It's optimized for finding new music. Tracks is optimized for holding the meaning of music you already have a relationship with. They're complementary, not competitive. Most Tracks users are also heavy Spotify or Apple Music users.

**"Why would someone use this instead of just writing in their notes app?"**
A notes app doesn't know the song. It doesn't resurface your entry on the anniversary. It doesn't recognize patterns across 200 entries. It doesn't show you that you've listened to the same artist during every major transition in your life. The music metadata is what makes the interpretation possible.

**"How do you get people to actually log?"**
Three entry points: Now Playing (the app detects what's on your phone and prompts you), ShazamKit (tap a button to identify ambient audio at a concert or party), and the share extension (share a song from Apple Music or Spotify directly into the app). Every path leads to a pre-filled create screen — the user just adds the why.

**"What's the retention story?"**
The On This Day notification is the retention engine. A year after logging something meaningful, the app brings it back. That experience — reading something you wrote during a version of yourself you've almost forgotten — is the product at its best. Users who experience it once understand immediately why they'll keep logging.

**"Who is this for?"**
Not a demographic. A psychographic: people who already associate songs with moments. The kind of person who says "that album was my whole era." They're 18–35 skewing, reflective, emotionally aware, heavy music listeners. They don't need to be convinced the concept matters — they just need the place to hold it.

**"What's the long-term vision?"**
The shift from rearview mirror to windshield. Early Tracks is about capturing and revisiting the past. Mature Tracks uses that accumulated data to serve present emotional needs: "I'm feeling anxious — here are your songs that historically helped." "Last October your mood dipped and your music got heavy. It's October." That turns Tracks from a journal into a personal intelligence layer. That's the difference between a nice app and an indispensable one.
