# Tracks — Vision & Product North Star

This document captures the core "why" behind every decision. When a feature feels ambiguous, come back here.

## What Tracks Actually Is

Not a journaling app. Not a music player. Not a mood tracker.

**Tracks is a nostalgia engine.** It organizes the emotional associations people already have with music — and turns them into a structured, living record of who they've been.

The insight: music is the strongest involuntary memory trigger humans have. A song can transport you to a specific afternoon, a specific version of yourself, a feeling you'd forgotten existed. Tracks makes that power intentional. You log the association when it's alive, and the app returns it to you — months or years later — as emotional time travel.

**Logging is the investment. Resurfacing is the dividend.**

---

## The Tagline

> Every song holds a moment.
> Keep them somewhere that remembers.

Secondary positioning line:

> Your life is already a soundtrack. Discover it.

## The Category

**Organizing nostalgia.**

This is not a sub-category of journaling, music, or wellness. It's its own thing. When someone asks what Tracks is, the answer isn't "it's like Day One but with songs." The answer is: "it organizes nostalgia."

That framing survives any feature — era clustering, insights, share cards, maps, AI summaries. It all coheres under one idea.

---

## Who This Is For

Not a demographic. A psychographic.

**People who already associate songs with moments.** The kind of person who says:
- "I can't hear that song without thinking about that summer."
- "That album was my senior year."
- "That song got me through that breakup."
- "I remember exactly where I was when I first heard this."

They don't need to be taught the concept. They just don't have a structured place to hold it. Tracks gives them that place.

**Primary audience**: reflective, nostalgic, emotionally aware people — across ages, but strongest with 18–35 who have enough life behind them to resurface, and enough life ahead to keep logging.

## The Core Loop

```
Listen → Log → Resurface → Reflect → Share → Repeat
```

Every feature should serve one of these six stages. If it doesn't, deprioritize it.

- **Listen**: the app intercepts an existing daily behavior (music listening)
- **Log**: the lowest-friction capture possible — song required, everything else optional
- **Resurface**: the magic — On This Day, eras, random rediscovery, pattern insights
- **Reflect**: the depth — looking back at who you were, what patterns emerge
- **Share**: the growth engine — era cards, yearly recap, moment exports
- **Repeat**: habit reinforces over time as the data gets richer

## The Emotional Arc

After 5 years of using Tracks, a user should feel — in this order:

1. **Nostalgic** — triggered by resurfacing: "this song was my winter"
2. **Grateful** — triggered by accumulation: "I lived a lot"
3. **Grounded** — triggered by patterns: "I've been through transitions before and I survived"
4. **Seen** — triggered by interpretation: "the app noticed something true about me"
5. **Shocked** — triggered by time distortion: "I haven't logged that artist in 3 years"

This arc is the product north star. Features that contribute to it are worth building. Features that don't, aren't.

## The Positioning Line

> **Spotify knows your music. Tracks knows what it means.**

This sentence does the work. Every Spotify user instantly understands the gap it fills. No explanation needed. This is the sentence that travels.

---

## The Differentiator From Day One

Day One stores entries. Tracks structures emotional memory into eras and patterns.

Day One helps you remember events. Tracks helps you remember *who you were* through the songs that were playing.

The real risk of building this wrong: "Day One but with songs." If that's all it is, you lose. The moat is interpretation — using the music + mood + time + text data to surface things the user didn't consciously notice about themselves.

---

## Monetization Philosophy

**Free tier monetizes logging. Premium tier monetizes meaning.**

Never charge for:
- Number of entries
- Basic search
- On This Day resurfacing
- Core logging features

These must feel free. Habit formation requires zero friction on the core loop.

Charge for:
- **Era clustering** — seeing your life organized into chapters
- **Pattern insights** — what the data reveals about you
- **Shareable era/moment cards** — beautiful exports
- **Unlimited photos** — storage-heavy, emotionally valuable
- **Yearly recap** — the Wrapped moment
- **AI narrative summaries** — the interpretation layer

The conversion trigger: *after 25–30 entries, show a locked Era card.* Not "upgrade for more storage." But: "Unlock the chapter you just lived."

**Target pricing**: $4.99/month or $39.99/year. Break-even at ~120 annual subscribers. Path to living off it at ~2,000.

## Brand Voice

**Soft in tone. Sharp in insight.**

The app speaks gently — but it notices things precisely. Examples:

| Too soft | Too sharp | Right |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| "This song feels special." | "63% of entries logged after 10pm." | "Most of your moments happen after 10pm. Night might be your truest hour." |
| "Here's a memory." | "Mood distribution: 40% reflective." | "You tend toward reflection this time of year." |

The language should feel like a thoughtful friend who has read everything you've written — not a therapist, not an algorithm.

## What "Done" Looks Like

If someone opens Tracks after 10 years and feels **nostalgic, grateful, grounded, seen, and shocked** — you built the right thing.

If it disappeared tomorrow, users should miss: *being reminded of moments they lived, and being able to relive them through music.*

That's the product. Everything else is in service of that.

## The Growth Problem (and the answer)

The app currently has no network effects. Every user's experience is completely independent of every other user. That is a ceiling.

Every app that reached millions did it because using it made you want to bring someone else in, or because someone else using it made your experience better.

**The answer is not a social network.** It's one mechanic that's better with two people than one:
- The couples soundtrack — one partner pulls the other in
- "You're Not Alone" — anonymous matched moments make the app feel alive and shared
- "Share this moment with someone" — a message that's worth sending, which is an acquisition loop
- **Shared collections** — the highest-leverage acquisition surface. A wedding collection with a QR code at the venue can bring in 20–30 new users from a single event. Couples, friend groups, families, concerts — every shared collection is a personalized invite campaign.

The viral surface is the shareable card — specifically a vertical, story-format card designed for Instagram and TikTok. "This song was my whole era" is already a cultural format. Tracks makes it real and personal. Every share is a free impression.

**The wedding insight**: weddings are cultural moments where music is already central and everyone wants to remember. A "Wedding Soundtrack" collection — where every guest logs what songs meant something during the day — becomes an artifact the couple treasures forever. It also introduces the app to 50–150 people at once. At scale, weddings could be the single largest acquisition channel.

## The Rearview Mirror Problem

The app is currently almost entirely backward-looking. That limits the daily reason to open it — the app is most useful *after* you've lived something.

The shift to make: use accumulated past data to serve present and future emotional needs.

- **Predictive comfort**: "I'm feeling anxious" → your songs that helped before, not Spotify's generic suggestions
- **Seasonal anticipation**: "Last October your mood dipped and your music got heavy. It's October."
- **Transition detection**: when logging patterns shift, the app quietly notices

This turns Tracks from a journal into a personal intelligence layer. That's the difference between a nice app and an indispensable one.

---

## The Legacy Angle

People are terrified of being forgotten. They're terrified of forgetting.

Tracks could be the place you build your musical autobiography — not just for yourself, but for the people who come after you. Parents log moments with their kids. People facing illness document their soundtrack. Someone who loses a parent can go back and understand what music meant to them.

This framing creates a different kind of user: one who pays forever, tells their family, and never churns. Not because of features — because they're building something that matters.

## Feature Decision Filter

Before building anything, ask:
1. Does this serve the core loop (listen → log → resurface → reflect → share)?
2. Does this contribute to the emotional arc (nostalgic → grateful → grounded → seen → shocked)?
3. Does this make resurfacing more magical, or logging more frictionless?
4. Does this create a reason to involve a second person?
5. Does it serve the user *right now*, not just retrospectively?

If none of the above: deprioritize.
